# Porting decisions for later review

## Working policy (user instruction, 2026-09-12)

When reasonably confident in the right answer and reversal would not require
substantial effort, make the decision and record it here or in the batch doc
for later review. Continue without asking for confirmation. Record behavior
changes explicitly, with evidence and validation; do not label them exact
compatibility. Ask when confidence is insufficient or reversal would be costly.

## Locked-door message padding — approved, review with Go conversion

Initialize unused bytes in the fixed 52-byte notification. The client interprets
only the header, NUL-terminated localization key and selector. Original C left
padding uninitialized; a zero-initialized C array now establishes deterministic
output for the upcoming Go conversion. No meaningful fields or string acceptance
rules change. Reversal is one initializer, though preserving indeterminate
padding is not recommended. The user explicitly approved this correction.
Evidence and reproducible tests: [PLAYER_CONTROLS.md](PLAYER_CONTROLS.md).

## Default-equipment modifier word — review with controls conversion

Initialize the entire 20-byte C modifier array in 4EF7D0. Only four descriptor
words were assigned, but the attribute helper copies a fifth word into items.
Chosen under the standing policy: use deterministic zero for that uninitialized
word, matching the future Go array default. Reversal is one initializer. Retain
all descriptor selection, ordering, callbacks and defined values. Evidence and
validation are recorded in [PLAYER_CONTROLS.md](PLAYER_CONTROLS.md).

## Spell phoneme class offset — review with spell lifecycle conversion

Correct the server phoneme helper's class-byte access before locking its C
baseline. `getObjectFromNetCode` returns `nox_object_t*`; adding 8 before the cast
advanced eight whole objects (6,176 bytes), instead of reading byte offset 8.
Nonplayer phoneme cases exposed an out-of-bounds read and crash. Cast to a byte
pointer before adding the offset, matching the client branch's class-field check.
The new corpus checks male/female and nonplayer sounds in both server and client
paths. This is a deliberate bug correction, not exact preservation of the invalid
read. Chosen under the standing policy; reversal is one expression.

## Buff power accessor — review with spell lifecycle conversion

Change server.Object.EnchantPower from BuffsDur to BuffsPower. The C accessor
uses the byte power array; the existing Go method incorrectly returned the
16-bit duration. The locked C corpus independently distinguishes duration 1,234
from power 7 and covers signed C byte returns. Native callers now receive power.
Chosen under the standing policy; reversal is one field access. This intentional
correction is separate from exact C/native lifecycle compatibility.

## Creature-tag caster read — review with sustained spells conversion

Move the caster-data read below the existing nil-caster guard in 530160 before
locking the C baseline. The source previously dereferenced the caster before
testing it. A dedicated nil-caster test already passes with the current compiler;
this is not evidence of an observed runtime crash. The change makes the intended
rejection defined in the source and independent of optimization. Positive input
behavior is unchanged. Chosen under the standing policy; reversal moves one line.
Evidence: `build/port-sustained-spells/c-tag-nil-before.log` and the committed
`TestSustainedSpellsTagNilCaster` regression case when this baseline is locked.

## Plasma direction predicate — preserve now, review as a gameplay change

Preserve the original expression in 531920: OR-ing the direction mask with 0xC
makes that part of the predicate always true. Enemy and interaction checks still
apply. The native helper evaluates the direction owner and preserves selection
behavior; all locked spatial captures remain unchanged. Any intended restriction
to targets in front should be a separate gameplay fix with explicit tests, not an
incidental change during conversion. This choice is reversible in one predicate
and follows the standing policy of documenting such decisions without pausing.
